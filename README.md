# a_tale_of_a_bond
A text-based RPG that can run on CMD terminal

This is a simple game, that is still in progress. You can build your own adventure through the super secret admin menu!

## Admin Menu
You can generate all the assets you want from monsters, chaning the MC stats, and editing the existing monsters from a Menu. You can even build your own story! All that from the Admin Menu, to enter it, type "java" when you're on the Main Menu page. Letters won't appear, that is why it's a super secret menu!
